1. Download the following extensions : rust-analyzer (Don't download the currently 'official'
   rust extension) , and then download codelldb for debugging. (Note: The C/C++ extention of 
   vscode offers better debugging, better info, but isn't as compatible with rust as codelldb)
2. Go to the terminal, cd to the folder where you want to store the projects, then write : 
    cargo new first_rust_project      (or any other project name)
    (This command createsa a new project for you, with an already working 'hello' world program)
3. cd to the 'first_rust_project' directory, and start working on the project
